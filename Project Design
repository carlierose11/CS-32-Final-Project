Features of the Swimulator 
  - take two ivy league swim teams and predict which team will win based off of personal best times 
      - each swimmer can only swim four events 
      - read in swimmer data from a file 
      - perhaps introduce randomness (prediction)
Roadmap 
  - High Priority 
      - create a data structure that can hold a swimmer 
      - simulate a swim meet between two teams
      - calculate number of points 
      - print the winners, detailed statistic info, results from events 
  - Medium Priority 
      - read in the swimmers from a file 
      - allow swimmers to not particpate in certain events (only participate in four)
      - add randomness (not always assumed to get best times)
  - Low Priority (if we have time) 
      - incorporate relays and diving 
      - optimizer
        - find combinations of events that give a team the highest chance of winning 
      - simulations (run many trials as opposed to one single meetï¼‰
