# CS-32-Final-Project
CS 32 Final Project with Sydney Lu and Carlie Rose
For our project we have decided to create a swim meet simulator (a swimulator). Using best times, we will create a simulator that will predict the outcome of the swim meet. We would show not just the outcome scores, but also, the event lineups that lead to the highest potential points. This optimal lineup would be compared with other teams' optimal lineups in order to determine the most likely outcome of the meet. While not a completely fool-proof simulator, it would give a good idea of how to approach a meet lineup/outcomes to expect.
